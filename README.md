The True American game from New Girl rules manual.

There are several other versions of this game out there on the web:
- [These broken "working rules"](https://www.trueamericanrules.com/working-rules/)
- [A reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewGirl/comments/s887s/rules_to_true_american_easy_to_understand/)
- [Another reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewGirl/comments/17nfg1/wrote_out_the_rules_for_true_american_thought_i/)
- Probably more...

The thing is, none of them work in real life.

Our rules work. The game rules are battle tested in real life university party battlegrounds. The diagram also (we think) makes sense.
